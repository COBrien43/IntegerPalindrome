# IntegerPalindrome
This project takes an integer from the user and checks whether it is a palindrome or not. 

## Instructions to build and run
Within App.java there is already a new a PalindromeChecker created, all you need to do is replace the number and click run App.

## Platform limitations
There are no known limitations that would affect the running of this code.

## Dependencies 
For the testing aspect of this project I used JUnit.

## Possible Improvements
In the future I would add a Scanner that takes the users input in a more user friendly way, rather than setting it in App.java.
